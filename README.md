# Introduction

Hi everyone, this my first steps with **Python**, **React**, **GraphQL** and **Neo4j**. This project is a simple shipped package tracker where we can create a Package and ship to different address up to delivery the package with the customer.

The API is build with **Flask** and the UI will be made with **React**.
